Got it! You can summarize it more cleanly in your README like this:

---

### 🟢 NvChad Configuration

This repository includes my **personalized NvChad configuration** for Neovim.

* Tweaks and personalizations applied on top of NvChad’s default setup.
* Safe to fork or delete the `.git` folder when cloning locally.

#### 🔧 Credits

* Inspired by [LazyVim Starter](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter)

---

This keeps it short and clear without mentioning specific `require` statements.

Do you want me to **update your README template** with this section included in the “Tools / Nvim” area?
