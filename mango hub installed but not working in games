If mango hub installed but not working in games run this in the terminal

MANGOHUD=1

if it is working but does not show ur dedicated gpu's perfomance

go in govelay to visual and make sure the pci device selected is the gpu u want, in my case it's the nvidia gpu 

In my case 
1:00:0 is nvidia 
00:02:0 in intel arc

so I selected 1:00:0
